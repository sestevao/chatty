## 💻 About the Project

The support-chat is an app that offers a real-time support chat (like those E-commerce chats)

This project was developed during the Node.js path in the fifth edition of NLW (Next Level Week). We learned concepts about what is an API, starting a project using Typescript and Express for route management.
